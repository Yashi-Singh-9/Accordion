# Accordion
The project involves creating an accordion component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The accordion displays a list of questions or headings, and when a user clicks on a question, the corresponding answer or content section expands while collapsing any previously opened section. This ensures that only one section remains open at a time.
